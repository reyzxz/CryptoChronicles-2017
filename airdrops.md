# OG Airdrop Chronicles (2017)

Back in the day, not many understood airdrops. I was already in the game, witnessing the chaos of crypto's early days.

## My Airdrop List:

- **Bitcoin Cash (BCH)**  
  Legendary airdrop from the Bitcoin fork. I received BCH when it was first distributed to BTC holders.

- **OmiseGO (OMG)**  
  Got it from an Ethereum community event. This was back when the Ethereum hype was real.

- **0x Protocol (ZRX)**  
  One of my favorite airdrops of 2017. A project focused on decentralized exchange on top of Ethereum.

- **Stellar Lumens (XLM)**  
  Stellar gave away XLM to BTC holders. It was a nice addition to my portfolio back when it was still cheap.

## Why This Matters to Me:
These airdrops were the start of my deeper dive into crypto. What began as a hobby turned into a serious pursuit. This is where I learned about the potential of hidden gems, Web3 communities, and the importance of networks in crypto.
