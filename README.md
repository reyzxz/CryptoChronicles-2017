# CryptoChronicles-2017

Welcome to my crypto time capsule.
Back in 2017, when most people barely knew what blockchain was, I dove headfirst into the chaos.

What’s Inside
	•	Early Airdrop OG - Claimed BCH, OMG, ZRX, XLM before people even knew what those letters meant.
	•	Rugpull Survivor - From shady altcoins to overhyped projects, I’ve taken hits most people wouldn’t survive.
	•	PoS Validator Operator - Battle-tested, running my own validator while everything else crashed and burned.
	•	Story of Hype and Mistakes - From selling BTC too early to getting drained by bad security decisions.
I’ve seen it all, lived through it, and learned.

Why This Repo Exists

This is my archive. A place to reflect on my journey - the wins, the losses, the lessons, and the madness that shaped me in this unforgiving space.

2025 and Beyond

Still here. Still grinding. Mapping airdrops, hunting alpha, running validators, and writing my own story.
This repo is a reminder: never stop moving forward.
